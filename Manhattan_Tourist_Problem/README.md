(Reference: O'Connell, Jonathan F. A dynamic programming model to solve optimisation problems using GPUs. Diss. Cardiff University, 2017.)     

## 1. Greedy Approach     

## 2. Dynamic Programming     

## Goal: To implement both algorithms and see which one gives optimal solution.     
(Both algorithms are implemented in 'Manhattan_Tourist_Problem.py' in current repository, **jwyang21/Dynamic_Programming/Manhattan_Tourist_Problem/**).
