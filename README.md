# Dynamic_Programming     
Implementation of some Dynamic Programming examples.     

## 1. Manhattan Tourist Problem     
### 1-1. Greedy Algorithm     
### 1-2. Dynamic Programming     
Let's see which algorithm gives optimal solution!     

## 2. Sequence Alignment(especially, biological one)     
### 2-1. Global Sequence Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm)     
### 2-2. Local Sequence Alignment (Smith-Waterman Algorithm)
